                        headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great
                        to just skip that?</p>

                    <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We
                        were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
                        headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                    <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                        headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!</p>

                <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                    collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                    <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                     They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share
                    our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.
